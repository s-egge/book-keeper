# Book Keeper
Book Keeper originated as a group collaboration between myself and three other students for a Mobile Web Developement class. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/osu-cs492-599-w24/final-project-bookkeeper). I forked the repo after the class ended and have continued to make changes and enhancements.

Book Keeper is a mobile application designed to enhance the reading experience for avid and casual readers alike. The app allows users to search for books, add them to a personalized library, track their reading progress, and take notes on each book. It provides a user-friendly interface and allows users to access a database of books via [Open Library's Book API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to create an interactive reading management system. 

Reading a complicated book and finding it hard to keep track of who is who, and what they're doing? Ever put a book down for several months and had to restart because you wouldn't remember what was going on? Book Keeper aims to help with these issues by providing an easy interface for note-taking and retrieval, aiding users in maintaining engagement with their favorite books.

### Add Books From OpenLibrary
Utilizing Open Library's Book API, you can search for books by title or author to add to your library. Books can also be removed from this page, and if a link is available, the cart button will open your phone's browser to view the book on Amazon. The search bar will remember previous queries to enable the user to quickly go back to previous things they've searched.

A nav drawer allows the user to navigate between the library and book search screen, as well as displays the five most recently viewed or edited books that can be used to navigate directly to that book's detail page.
